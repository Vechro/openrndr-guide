# File drops

OPENRNDR programs can listen to file drop events. File drop events are generated by a user dragging and releasing one or more file icons onto the program window. 
 
```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        window.drop.listen {
            println("${it.files.size} files dropped at ${it.position}")
        }
    }
}
```
