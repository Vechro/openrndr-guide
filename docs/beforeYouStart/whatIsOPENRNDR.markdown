# A simple OPENRNDR program
Here we show a very simple program written using OPENRNDR.

```kotlin
fun main() = application {
    program {
        extend {
            drawer.clear(ColorRGBa.PINK)
            drawer.fill = ColorRGBa.WHITE
            drawer.circle(drawer.bounds.center, abs(cos(seconds)) * height * 0.5)
        }
    }
}
```
