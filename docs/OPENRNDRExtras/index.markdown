# OPENRNDR Extras (ORX)

The ORX project is a library of tools that can be used in OPENRNDR based programs. ORX contains implementations of
datastructures, algorithms and utilities for (mostly) computational graphics. You can find the ORX source code and
additional documentation in the [ORX repository](https://github.com/openrndr/orx)

## Using OPENRNDR extras

Using the OPENRNDR extras is a matter of adding an additional Maven repository and selected dependencies to your
Gradle project.

The [openrndr-template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template) project makes this simple as 
the repositories are already set up and one only has to 
 
1. Open the `build.gradle.kts` file
2. Uncomment the desired module names under `orxFeatures`
3. Save
4. Reimport Gradle projects: if using Idea choose Reimport All Gradle Projects from the Gradle panel.
